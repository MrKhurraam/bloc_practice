-> difference between bloc and cubic is that cubic doesn't have events.
Cubit is function based and Bloc is Event based.
So we can use functions instead of events in cubit. thus is helps to
avoid boilerplate code(un-necessary code to fire event).
Also we can emit state as many time as we wants in Cubit where-as in Bloc we cannot emit any state
as long as we don't add any event.

-> In bloc event were necessary to fire some state but not in cubit.
